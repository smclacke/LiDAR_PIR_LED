-- the what

 - 1x PIR per roughly one meter to detect general motion/change in lighting etc and wake the system up

 - 1x LiDAR with detection radius of 5-1500cm up to 15 meters distance, depending on the position of retected motion, addressed LEDs wake up with chosen effect

 - 1x power supply per 5 meter roll LED

 - 1x arduino in combination with 1x ESP32 per LED roll (??)


-----

-- next steps

- add ESP32
- sensor configuration testing
- leds
- led libraries
- test ESP32 connection, distance, remote control
- installation of everything (mounting boards/boxes etc), soltering, waterproofing, fire safe


-- need

- esp32 + adapter 
- jumpers
- led protection stuff? led wires + connection stuff

 

 -----

  - horizontal strip and vectical pillar roogams
  - think height, sensors in first and second half, one reacting to lower motions, one higher, 16 rolls, octagon shape 

  - niels brings smaller prototypes utrecht, bring all hardware for build day
  - make prototype// possiblily already something we can exhibit

  - think difference between programming for horizontal and vertical
  - leds covered or not
  - wrapping, up in lines,
