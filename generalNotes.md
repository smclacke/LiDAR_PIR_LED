**File setup** 

	.ino: This is the default file extension for sketches written in 
		the Arduino IDE, which is used for ESP32, Arduino boards, and others.

	.h: Used for header files, typically used to define functions, constants, 
		and variables that can be shared across different files.

	.cpp: C++ source files (can be used for more advanced Arduino/ESP32 projects).

	Hardware interface: UART USB CDC
	Default baudrate - 460800
